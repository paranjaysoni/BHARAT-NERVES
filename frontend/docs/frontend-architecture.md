# Frontend Architecture

The Project Aegis frontend uses Next.js with the App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and a `src/` directory.

## App Router

The App Router lives in `src/app`.

- `layout.tsx` defines the root HTML shell, metadata, and global `AppShell`.
- `page.tsx` redirects `/` to `/control-room`.
- `globals.css` defines Tailwind layers, base styles, and theme variables.

Current product routes under `src/app` are skeleton pages only:

- `/control-room`
- `/scenario-simulator`
- `/trade-sentinel`
- `/ai-parliament`
- `/crisis-commander`
- `/impact-dashboard`
- `/resources`
- `/reports`
- `/settings`

## Folder Structure

- `src/app`: Next.js App Router files.
- `src/components`: Reusable UI components grouped by product area.
- `src/layouts`: Page and application layout compositions.
- `src/hooks`: Shared React hooks.
- `src/lib`: Shared client libraries and setup helpers.
- `src/services`: Frontend service clients and API integration wrappers.
- `src/data`: Static MVP JSON data and local fixtures.
- `src/types`: Shared TypeScript types.
- `src/constants`: Shared constants and configuration values.
- `src/styles`: Additional style modules if needed later.
- `src/utils`: Shared utility functions.

## Component Organization Plan

- `components/layout`: Shell, header, sidebar, and navigation components.
- `components/dashboard`: Dashboard-specific presentation components.
- `components/map`: Map-related presentation components.
- `components/scenario`: Scenario simulator components.
- `components/agents`: AI Parliament and agent-facing components.
- `components/commander`: Crisis Commander components.
- `components/shared`: Small reusable components used across product areas.

## Layout Components Added

- `components/layout/AppShell.tsx`: Composes the persistent sidebar, topbar, and main content area.
- `components/layout/Sidebar.tsx`: Provides product branding, primary navigation, active route state, and system status.
- `components/layout/Topbar.tsx`: Provides platform heading, corridor selector placeholder, notification indicator, time widget, and theme control.
- `components/layout/ThemeToggle.tsx`: Provides a small class-based light/dark theme toggle using the existing CSS variable strategy.

## Shared Components Added

- `components/shared/PageHeader.tsx`: Standard title and description block for placeholder pages.
- `components/shared/SectionCard.tsx`: Basic card wrapper for page sections.
- `components/shared/StatusBadge.tsx`: Small semantic status badge for simple status labels.

## Data Folder Purpose

The `data` folder will hold MVP JSON datasets and fixtures, including future Odisha Cyclone Corridor nodes, routes, stress indicators, and impact assumptions.

## Services Folder Purpose

The `services` folder will hold frontend clients for future backend APIs and external integrations. It should not contain business logic that belongs on the backend.

## Product Pages

The following pages exist as placeholders and do not contain real product logic yet:

- Control Room
- Scenario Simulator
- Trade Sentinel
- AI Parliament
- Crisis Commander
- Impact Dashboard
- Resources
- Reports
- Settings
